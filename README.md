# Pewlett-Hackard Retirement Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

In the scenario for this module, Pewlett-Hackard, a large and well-established company, is concerned about the potential for a significant number of its senior employees retiring in the near future. They want to know how severe this mass retirement might be and to find ways to plan for this eventuality. Initial research indicated that the wave of retirements would indeed cause serious disruption to the work of the company.

After this was reported to the senior management of the company, they have decided to create a mentorship program that would pair soon-to-retire employees with willing junior employees. The new task assigned by senior management is twofold. The first task is to determine the number of employees who will be retiring (by their titles). The second task, then, is to identify the employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
